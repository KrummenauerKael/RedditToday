## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt` (Note: Some libraries may be outdated and will require changes to work with the latest versions.)

## Usage

- Ensure you have a `credentials.json` file with your Reddit API credentials in the project directory.
- `stopwords.txt` file contains a list of common stopwords used in text processing. It provides a list of words that the script will ignore and not count, removing words from the text file will make them countable.
